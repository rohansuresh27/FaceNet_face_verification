# FaceNet_face_verification
This repository takes inspiration from modern day "Face Unlock" feature found in smartphones. The repository is based on a demonstration of face recognition using the FaceNet network (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). The network learns an embedding for the required user and uses it for subsequent verification attempts.

## How to use :
The project requirements can be installed using
  pip install -r requirements.txt
The project can be run using
	python main.py
